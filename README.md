# Updating ‘Homer’ - A Smart Home App Simulation

## Project Description
Welcome to the repository for "Homer", a smart home application simulation built with Flutter. This project was created as part of a YouTube tutorial and serves as a practical demonstration of Flutter's capabilities in creating interactive and intuitive interfaces.
I took version one of the project and gave it a fresh look using custom shapes in Flutter. These unlock a world of unique and engaging designs that go way beyond basic widgets.
Flutter path comes with methods like moveTo, lineTo, and arcTo (and more!) to craft some seriously cool shapes. It might take a little practice to map out the points, but trust me, the results are FIRE.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Video Walkthrough
For a detailed walkthrough of the project, check out the video tutorial on YouTube. The video showcases the building process of "Homer", emphasizing the mesmerizing allure of Flutter animations. You can watch the video here.
